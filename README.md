# optimize-anything
A library for optimizing anything. Implemented in c++ and eigen, interface built with python and sympy.

## Features:
- Rational numbers and symbolic computation
- Two phase simplex algorithm (with Bland's rule)

(todo)
- Fourier-Motzkin Elimination
- Column generation
- interior point methods
- cutting plane methods
- Christofides algorithm (tsp)
- gradient descent
- simulated annealing (application: CCO 2018 problem 2)

(very far in the future todo)
- other combinatorial optimization (euclidian tsp?)
- stochastic programming
- quadratic programming
- robust optimization
- semidefinite programming

## Notes:
- I'm calling the main folder simplex until I can think of a better name
